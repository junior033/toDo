    This is a simple application that creates a RESTfull Express API.
    It will give users the ability to CREATE, READ UPDATE, and DELETE items from a To Do list.
  
  <!--- www.example.com/ -->
  
  -- In order to view all of the To Do items in this application, make an HTTP GET request to /api/items.
  Your sample response body will look like the following:

  ```
  [
      {
          "id: 1,
          "item": "the name of tyhe things we're launching",
          "completed": false
      },
      {

      }
  ]

  - in order to edit the contents of a single To Do item, make a PUT request to /api/items/id: should look like the following

{
	"id": 2,
	"item": "get some beer",
	"completed": true
}

- In order to delete a single item for our To Do items API, make a DELETE request
